Here I have developed page object framework with BDD test development
There are total 6 test scenarios
The project can be run in the following manner:

1. mvn test from the command prompt
2. Right click on feature file and run as - Cucumber Feature
3. Run as maven test from Eclipse
4. Specific feature file run - mvn test -Dcucumber.options=”feature/RSComponentTestCases.feature”

Flow for each is explained below:

   Scenario: Login with User and proceed to payment
  > User prekshakasliwal with password logs in 
  > Success msg check for text Welcome preksha
  > Search is performed
  > Search item is added to basket
  > Checkout Securly is checked
  
    Scenario: Login with User and check for Filter labels and Table headings
  > User prekshakasliwal with password logs in 
  > Success msg check for text Welcome preksha
  > Search is performed
  > Filter options and Table heading labels are checked to be as expected
   
   Scenario: Login with User Apply filter after Search
  > User prekshakasliwal with password logs in 
  > Success msg check for text Welcome preksha
  > Search is performed
  > String for searched is matched after applying filter
  
    Scenario: Login with User and remove selected Item from cart
  > User prekshakasliwal with password logs in 
  > Success msg check for text Welcome preksha
  > Search is performed
  > Searched item is added to Basket
  > And removed from alert shown
  
    Scenario Outline: Login with User and search for more Options
   > User prekshakasliwal with password logs in 
  > Success msg check for text Welcome preksha
  > Search is performed
  > Strings are checked , added as an example for Scenario Outline implementation
  
  
 Enhancements :
  1. Red highlight for element currently being worked on
  2. Implicit and Explicit waits 
  3. Screenshot for Failure 
  4. Common code at one place
  5. Common method to verify labels from list- written in homepage
